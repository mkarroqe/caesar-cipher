# Caesar (salad) Cipher
### Who, the roman guy?
Julius Caesar ruled Rome back in 60 BC until he was dramatically stabbed in the back.  He created this cipher to encrypt his private messages to hide them from his political enemies.  It is a simple cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a set number of letters in the alphabet.
